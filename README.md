Predicting a spotify hit



Project Title: The Spotify Audio Analytics & Popularity Predictor
The Goal: Build a pipeline that analyzes audio features of songs (danceability, energy, acousticness, etc.) to understand what makes a song popular, and then train a model to predict a song’s popularity score.

This project is perfect because the data is intuitive (we all know what "loudness" sounds like), but it requires significant cleaning and mathematical transformation to be useful for a machine learning model.

1: Data Cleaning (Pandas & NumPy)

2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Seaborn & Matplotlib)

3: Feature Engineering 

4: Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)
